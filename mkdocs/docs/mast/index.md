# What is Mast 

Mast is an abbreviation for Multiple Agent Story Telling. It is for writing in a narrative flow that tells a 'story'. The stroy has multiple agents: players, non-player characters, etc. Each of these agents have their own story and those stories can have multiple side plots.

Stories have a forward moving flow. There is a beginning, a middle and an end. Mast has a programming flow that keep the story moving forward. Mast also allows for interactive narrative this allows for choice and branching of the story, revisiting aspects of the story etc. With this it still flows the story on a single path.

Mast in Artemis Cosmos the multiple agents are the player consoles, the ships and various characters that can be on ships, etc. Artemis cosmos has the ability to add much more characters to the game. For example there can be multiple characters on a space stations that you may interact with. The Damage Control teams can have richer stories and each can be unique.

Mast provides and new simple programming language that enables:

* Language that flows more like a narrative or film script
* Easy and rich GUIs for the pause scene and the Artemis Cosmos consoles
* a Task/State Driven system managing multiple tasks in parallel e.g. a quest with side quests
* Behavior tree for complex AI and Dialogs
* I similar to Visual Novel systems e.g. RenPy, Inkle Ink, and Choice script
